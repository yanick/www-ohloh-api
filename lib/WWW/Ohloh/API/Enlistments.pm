=head1 NAME

WWW::Ohloh::API::Enlistments

=head1 VERSION

version 1.0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::Ohloh::API;
    use WWW::Ohloh::API::Enlistments;

    my $ohloh = WWW::Ohloh::API( api_key => $key );

    my $enlistments = $ohloh->get_enlistments( project_id => 123 );

    while ( my $e = $enlistments->next ) {
        print $e->repository->url;
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

W::O::A::Enlistments returns a list of enlistments for a project.

The object doesn't retrieve all enlistmentss from the Ohloh
server in one go, but rather fetch them in small groups as
required.  If you want to download all enlistments at the
same time, you can use the B<all()> method:

    my @e = $ohloh->get_enlistments( sort => 'module_name' )->all;

=head1 NAME

WWW::Ohloh::API::Enlistments - a set of Ohloh project enlistments

=head1 METHODS 

=head2 new( %args )

Creates a new W::O::A::Enlistments object.  It accepts the following 
arguments:

=head3 Arguments

=over

=item ohloh => I<$ohloh>

Mandatory.  Its value is the L<WWW::Ohloh::API> object that will be used
to query the Ohloh server.

=item max => I<$n>

The maximum number of enlistments the set will contain.  If you want to 
slurp'em all, set it to 'undef' (which is the default).

=back

=head2 all

Returns the retrieved enlistments' information as
L<WWW::Ohloh::API::Enlistment> objects.

=head2 next( I<$n> )

Returns the next I<$n> enlistment (or all remaining enlistments if there are
less than I<$n>), or C<undef> if there is no more enlistments
to retrieve.  After it returned C<undef>, subsequent calls to B<next> will reset
the list.  If I<$n> is not given, defaults to 1 entry.

=head2 max

Returns the maximum number of enlistments the object will return, or C<undef>
if no maximum has been set.

=head2 total_entries

Returns the number of entries selected by the query. 

B<Beware>: this number can change during the life of the object!  Each
time the object retrieves a new batch of entries, this number is updated
with the value returned by the Ohloh server, which could differ from its
last invication is 
entries have been added or removed since the last retrieval.
